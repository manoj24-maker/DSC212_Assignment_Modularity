# DSC212_Assignment_Modularity

When we observe the values of the various metrics for all nodes over multiple iterations, then we can conlude that nodes 0 and node 33 are the most central to the graph. The high metric value of these nodes is indicative to the fact that these nodes are maximally connected in the graph. After performing modularity clustering we can observe that nodes 0 and 33 occupy central connected positions in the 2 of the three distrinct clusters. 

If the community structure has dense communities, then degree centrality is high (as in karate club graph).  On the other hand if we have more nodes connecting multiple communities, then betweeness centrality increases. Nodes that are relatively close to the centre of the graph have high closeness centrality. Hence close community structures with high density clusters that is overall well connected have high metric values.
